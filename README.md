# Test-Repo
Messing with Git a little bit. This sentence I am editing in VIM. Now I  see that it is good to know all of these tools. You can get so much done without going to github.com. 

Goal of this project:

add some files
remove some files
overall: use the bare minimums of github

This is take two. I had so make this line of changes becuase I did not follow the correct steps.

this is not pushing to GitHub!! why?
